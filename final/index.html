            About 17% of University of Maryland students experienced low levels of food security, according to a
            study
            released in 2019 by the university’s counseling Center Research Unit, with 20% of students experiencing
            food

            “Not having regular access to a variety of foods affects every aspect of a student's wellness,” said UMD
            registered dietician Jane Jakubczak.</p>
        <p>Jakubczak, a registered dietician that has worked at the University of Maryland for 20 years, works with the
            University Health Center to help students establish a healthy relationship with food and their body.</p>

        <p>“Not knowing if or where your next meal will come from causes extreme stress and anxiety which can lead to
            depression,” Jakubczak said “Not being able to nourish your body and brain with enough calories and a
            variety of essential nutrients directly affects a student's ability to focus, retain information and
            comprehension.” </p>

            Jakubczak said the biggest concern she sees with students’ eating habits is skipping meals. Oftentimes,
            students will skip meals throughout the day, then at night may blame themselves for not having the willpower
            to make nutritious decisions.</p>

                    She said that if someone is not getting nourishment throughout the day, they will crave something
                    quick at
                    night to be fueled with energy and ultimately consuming more sugar and fat.
                    “This is our body’s defense against starvation,” Jakubczak said.</p>

            The University of Maryland offers various resources such as The Campus Pantry and Peer Nutrition Coaching at
            the Health Center to try to combat the issue through individualized nutrition planning and access to free
            food. The Peer Nutrition Coaching aims to support students through individualized planning to better form
            healthy
            eating habits. Jakubczak said they take into account the students' likes and dislikes, schedule, cooking
            skills and interest, and access to food to help the student come up with a way of eating that fits their
            life.</p>
        <p>
            Free food is available at The Campus Pantry is supplied by Terp Farm, located about 15 miles from campus at
            the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources.
            In addition to providing free food for students, The Campus Pantry also hosts a teaching kitchen where they
            teach students new recipes.</p>

                    The Campus Pantry is located on the ground floor of the South Campus Dining building and is open
                    Monday,
                    Wednesday, and Friday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. All current students with a UMD ID card are eligible.
                    Charlay Guarshow,a senior secondary education and studio arts double major, said in previous
                    semesters, she
                    went to the Campus Pantry every day they were open and continues to go about once a week.</p>

            “I find it beneficial,” Guarshow said. ”I think there’s times when I don’t have the time or money to get
            food anywhere on campus so I just go here because it’s quick.”
            Guarshow said she tends to get frozen food or prepared meals at the pantry because it is quick and easy for
            her to eat. Guarshow has attended multiple events at the teaching kitchen where she learned quick and easy
            recipes. </p>
