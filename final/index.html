    <h1>Food Security and Resources</h1>
    <p>About 17% of UMD students experienced low levels of food security, according to a Food Access and Student
        Well-Being Study released in 2019 by the University of Maryland Counseling Center Research Unit. In the year
        leading up to the study 20% of UMD students experienced food insecurity.

        “Not having regular access to a variety of foods affects every aspect of a student's wellness,” said UMD
        registered dietician Jane Jakubczak.

        Jakubczak is a registered dietician that has worked at the University of Maryland for 20 years. She works with
        the University Health Center to help students establish a healthy relationship with food and their body.

        “Not knowing if or where your next meal will come from causes extreme stress and anxiety which can lead to
        depression. Not being able to nourish your body and brain with enough calories and a variety of essential
        nutrients directly affects a student's ability to focus, retain information and comprehension,” said Jakubczak.

        Jakubczak said the biggest concern she sees with students’ eating habits is skipping meals. Oftentimes, students
        will skip meals throughout the day, then at night may blame themselves for not having the willpower to make
        nutritious decisions.

        She said that if someone is not getting nourishment throughout the day, they will crave something quick at night
        to be fueled with energy. Ultimately, that means individuals are consuming more sugar and fat.

        “This is our body’s defense against starvation,” said Jakubczak.

        The University of Maryland offers various resources such as The Campus Pantry and Peer Nutrition Coaching at the
        Health Center.

        The Peer Nutrition Coaching provides an individualized approach to support students having healthy eating
        habits. Jakubczak said they take into account the students' likes and dislikes, schedule, cooking skills and
        interest and access to food to help the student come up with a way of eating that fits their life.

        The Campus Pantry is located on the ground floor of the South Campus Dining building. They are open Monday,
        Wednesday, and Friday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.. All current students with a UMD ID card are eligible.

        The free food available at The Campus Pantry is supplied by Terp Farm, which is located about 15 miles from
        campus at the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources.

        In addition to providing free food for students, The Campus Pantry also hosts a teaching kitchen where they
        teach students new recipes.

        Charlay Guarshow is a senior secondary education and studio arts double major. Guarshow said in previous
        semesters, she went to the Campus Pantry every day they were open and continues to go about once a week.

        “I find it beneficial,” said Guarshow, ”I think there’s times when I don’t have the time or money to get food
        anywhere on campus so I just go here because it’s quick.”

        Guarshow said she tends to get frozen food or prepared meals at the pantry because it is quick and easy for her
        to eat. Guarshow has attended multiple events at the teaching kitchen where she learned quick and easy recipes.
